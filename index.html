    <p1>As a newly admitted student to the studies of computer science, Iâ€™ve embarked on a journey to gain insight on the modern norm of education that lives adjacent to our habitual lives: coding.<br> My name is Sami Zabadneh, and I was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois my entire life, embracing the changes of my generation.<br> I am a student of NU's coding bootcamp which has floated my interest in web development. My everyday hobbies are watching movies, running, and martial arts.<br> I practice Seven Star Praying Mantis Kung Fu. My dream is to book a role in a movie. My acting inspiration spawned from watching my favorite Italian actors perform. I am currently a student at Northeastern Illinois University as an undergraduate studying computer science with a focus in cybersecurity.  </p1>
